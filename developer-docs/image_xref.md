# Image Xref

- This is a reference of all of the images that RKE2 uses.
- It includes links to all binaries that are in each image and how they are built.
- This is from the image point of view, binaries might be listed multiple times.

The goal is to list all of the images we use,
 what they are based on,
 what Go binaries are in them and how they got there.
